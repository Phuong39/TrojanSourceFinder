# Trojan Source Vulnerability *Kezako* ?

## From the trick to the Vulnerability
### The trick
### Why it could be harmful?
In fact it is not a new discovery, as these bugs/tricks have been known for like 20 years but it has to be widely and publicly reported. It is why the research give the vulnerability a name.

## How to detect it in a different way
* Github [print a warning](https://github.co/hiddenchars) when file contains unicode bidirection algorithms characters. *(does Gitlab detect it?)*
* [nickboucher/bidi-viewer](https://github.com/nickboucher/bidi-viewer): View and Analyze trojan source in a React-based webapp
* If your text editors have a “strip all comments” mode, enable it.
